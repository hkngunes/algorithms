# algorithms
In this repository, I study on some common algorithms by focusing on clean code applications.

# code commit checklist
1. Try to obey Google C++ Style Guide that is also given at Docs folder.
2. Write well designed comments that can be previewed in VS Code.
3. Write pseudocode of the algorithm at the beginning of the file written in that file.
4. Align max number of character at one line to 80 in code files.
5. Write at least one test for each algorithm that can be easily manipulated to test with different arguments.
